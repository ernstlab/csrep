Hello! Wecome to CSREP. Our manuscript was submitted to ISMB 2021. We plan to make the manuscript available on BioRXiv shortly.
# Data Availability
## Male-Female comparision
The data of histogram for differential scores for Male-minus-Female is available at https://public.hoffman2.idre.ucla.edu/ernst/2K9RS/Male_minus_Female/multi_logistic/histogram/ 
## CSREP scores for cell groups from ROADMAP
The data of genome-wide CSREP score for all cell groups in ROADMAP is available at https://public.hoffman2.idre.ucla.edu/ernst/2K9RS/
The 11 cell groups's subfolders include: blood Blood_other Digestive Brain ESC ES-deriv Heart iPSC Muscle Skin Sm_Muscle. To access the csrep score for a group, enter `<cell_group_name>`/`csrep`
## Other data
For any other data related to the paper, please email Prof. Jason Ernst or grad student Ha Vu. 
# Code availability
## Calculate CSREP scores for summarizing a group of samples
This code is currently inside the rep_chrom_pipeline. We are still trying to figure out how to make the program most user-friendly. Please give us bits of time. 
## Calculate differential CSREP scores for two groups of samples
